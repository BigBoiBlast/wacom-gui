%changelog
* Tue Jun 5 2018 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.2.1-3
- Fixed issue with sigsegv exit error 139; was race condition closing UI before config file completed closing on exit
* Mon Jun 4 2018 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.2.1
- Fixed naming issue with PTH-860 (was named PTH-680)
- Fixed regression with touch detection (Issue #11)
- Fixed: when shift key is pressed by itself it was not being set as a control modifier.  Shift/Alt/Ctrl should now work as stand-alone shift modifiers
* Mon May 28 2018 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.2.0-2
- Fixed issues with single screen tablet configuration
- Updated tablet names for PTH-660/PTH-680 to be consistent with naming scheme
- Fixed issue with touch not being properly detected due to change in device name detection
* Wed May 23 2018 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.2.0b-1
- updated keybind.cfg file to use /usr/local/bin/wacom-gui
* Wed May 23 2018 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.2.0-1
- updated SPEC file to include dependancies, clean up code (fixes provided by jcpearson)
- Added missing image for PTH-651 (noted missing by jcpearson)
- Do not show pad menu when a tablet does not have buttons (fix suggested by jcpearson)
- Per tablet configs (request from jcpearson)
- Added buttons to enable/disable pad buttons as well as a disable/enable all buttons (request from jcpearson)
- Made help page "pretty"; gets a weird graphical glitch on refresh though (known issue)
- tweaked layout of stylus/eraser config to be more visually consistant
- tweaked layout of pad config to be more visually consistant
- added warning on exit notifying saving of config will occur
- Fixed: eraser pressure curve was being saved and would be set correctly but it was not reflected in the GUI on reload
- Added: ground work for detecting multiple tablets at once; configuring still requires one device at a time but can load configs for all connected devices
- Known Issue: You can not connect 2 devices of the same type, will not load configs correctly
- Known Issue: On exit throws exit code 139; config is saved correctly but something isn't terminating correctly... need to track down
* Wed May 16 2018 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.1.11-1
- Locked GUI size to be static; allowing resize was the cause of the sensitivity test area bugging out (I think)
- Rolling in patches from jcpearson (all listed below)
- Added new tablets/cintiqs: PTH-680, DTH-1620, DTK-1300
- Added check if touch is available before trying to reset it (doesn't break but presents error in shell)
- Added Help page (I modified to span width of window for easier reading)
- Added service to start configs on login, along with udev rules
- Created /usr/local/bin/wacom-gui wrapper for easier command-line execution
* Fri May 11 2018 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.1.10-3
- changed screen detection to use MapToOutput (request from jcpearson)
- can detect more that 2 screens at a time
- fixed issue with single monitor causing crash
- removed legacy code used for screen detection (caused crash)
- added warning pop-up when tablet not detected (request from jcpearson)
* Fri Apr 06 2018 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.1.9-1
- added warning pop-up when tablet not detected (request from jcpearson)
- fixed issue with toggle not working with misaligned screens (issue reported by jcpearson)
* Mon Oct 23 2017 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.1.8b-1
- broke writing the config file... that was stupid of me
* Mon Oct 23 2017 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.1.8-1
- broke touch for older tablets
- newer libwacom reports tablets with a different name; ensured tablet name reported correctly
* Fri Oct 20 2017 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.1.7-1
- Added: PTH-660
- Added: pad button reset
- Added: restore defaults button to options page
- Fixed: PTH-660 for some reason inverts to negative value for pressure at 50% (0.5->-0.5); put in logic to check for this.  Only seems to effect the testing area
- Fixed: TabletPCButton option showing for eraser; is an invalid feature
- Fixed: Absolute/Relative mode was controlling stylus on the eraser page
- Fixed: some options were not being saved for the eraser due to above bug

- Added toggle for requiring tip to touch tablet to be "active"
